# Netflix Project -Tableau
The goal of this project is to give a detailed overview of Netflix's content catalog, focusing on various factors like the type of content (movie or TV show), its geographical availability, its ratings, release year, and its genre/category using Tableau’s data visualization tools.

## Overview
* Year Added: A trend line showing how many titles were added to Netflix each year between 2015–2020.

* Release Year: A stacked area chart that tracks the distribution of content release years. Most Netflix content has been produced after 2010.

* Country Distribution Map: An interactive world map that highlights where content originates. The U.S., India, U.K., and Canada are among the top contributors.

* Type Breakdown: A donut chart comparing the proportion of Movies vs. TV Shows which is 54.35 and 45.65%.

* Ratings: A dot plot showing the number of titles across various rating categories like PG, R, TV-14, and TV-MA.

* Genres (Word Cloud Map): A word cloud visualizing the most common genres. Larger words = more content.

* Content by Day of the Week: A matrix table showing how many movies and TV shows are added on each day of the week. Friday and Wednesday see the highest content drops.

* Movies are slightly more common than TV Shows.
